 This project is for my CIS453 Interface Desgn II Lab project.
 All designs were modeled in Figma and then recreated in Visual Studio Code utilizing React
 as the framework of choice.

 The project consist of a Single Page Application (SPA).
 My SPA is about telling users about my favorite games that are family friendly. 
 Then I explain to them how to play each game.
 Each page has a picture of the corresponding game with the instructions below that.
